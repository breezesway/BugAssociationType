# Bug Association Types
There are different types of the association between two bugs. We collected 16 types of bug associations from JIRA1. Supposing that bug α is in an association (e.g., **Blocked**) with bug β, the 16 types of bug associations are described as follows:

+ **Blocked**: α is blocked by β. β occurs before α, α is in association with β, and β has not been fixed when α occurs. α can be fixed only when β has been fixed. For instance, the cause of bug [*HIVE-12872*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-12872) is bug [*HIVE-11249*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-11249), and thus [*HIVE-11249*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-11249) needs to be fixed before fixing [*HIVE-12872*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-12872).

+ **Blocker**: α blocks β. It is the opposite association type of Blocked, i.e. we have to solve α first and then β. For instance, bug [*HIVE-22433*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-22433) blocks bug [*HIVE-22392*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-22392),thus if you want to add [*HIVE-22392*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-22392) this new feature, the [*HIVE-22433*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-22433) bug must be fixed first.

+ **ChildIssue**: α is a parent of β. α may involve multiple components, and β is a more specific link or step in α. For instance, bug [*HIVE-18196*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-18196) is in the association of **ChildIssue** with bug [*HIVE-18197*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-18197).
+ **Cloners**: α is a clone of β, i.e., α and β are the same issue and their descriptions are the same as well. For instance, bug [*HIVE-13889*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-13889)is in the association of **Cloners** with bug [*HIVE-13635*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-13635).
+ **Container**: α contains β. Specifically, β occurs before α, and α affects a large scope that contains the scope impacted by β. For instance, bug [*HIVE-12773*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-12773) is in the association of **Container** with bug [*HIVE-12039*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-12039).
+ **Dependency**: α dependency β. The solution of α depends on β, or repairing β is a precondition for repairing α. Unlike Blocked, Dependency is not a causal relationship. For instance, bug [*HIVE-17627*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-17627) is in the association of **Dependency** with bug [*HIVE-18518*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-18518).
+ **Dependent**: α depends upon β. Like Dependency, α also depends on β, but the difference is how to solve α depends on how β is solved. For instance, bug [*HIVE-11787*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-11787) is in the association of Dependent with bug [*HIVE-11786*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-11786).
+ **Duplicate**: α duplicates β. α and β represent the same bug. Unlike Cloners, Duplicate is reported by different people with different descriptions for the same bug, while Cloners is reported by the same person with the same description. For instance, bug [*HIVE-12746*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-12746) is in the association of Duplicate with bug [*HIVE-9020*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-9020).
+ **Incorporates**: α incorporates β. β is a part of α. Different from Container, Incorporates is a combination of multiple bugs. For instance, bug [*HIVE-9809*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-9809) is composed of 14 bugs such as bugs [*HIVE-9949*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-9949) and [*HIVE-9932*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-9932).Thus, [*HIVE-9809*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-9809) is in the association of Incorporates with [*HIVE-9949*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-9949) and [*HIVE-9932*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-9932).
+ **ParentFeature**: α is a child of β. ParentFeature is the opposite association type of ChildIssue.
+ **Problem/Incident**: α causes β. This is a straight-forward causal relationship. For instance, bug [*HIVE-20221*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-20221) is in the association of Problem/Incident with bug [*HIVE-20833*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-20833).
+ **Reference**: α relates to β. This is a relatively broad type of association, and any association that does not belong to the association types in this type list can be classified into this type. For isntance, bug [*HIVE-21675*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-21675) is in the association of Reference with bug [*HIVE-20462*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-20462).
+ **Regression**: α breaks β, i.e., the changes made to repair αresult in β. For instance, bug [*HIVE-12366*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-12366) breaks bug [*HIVE-18090*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-18090), thus [*HIVE-12366*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-12366) is in the association of Regression with [*HIVE-18090*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-18090).
+ **Related**: α is related to β. Related and Reference are a pair of opposite association types. The example for Reference can also be written as bug [*HIVE-20462*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-20462) is related to bug [*HIVE-21675*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-21675).
+ **Required**: α requires β. Fixing α requires that β is fixed first. Unlike Dependency, Reuqired does not represent a context, and β may just be an extra step in the process of fixing α. For instance, bug [*HIVE-12302*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-12302) is in the association of Required with [*HIVE-12175*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-12175).
+ **Supercedes**: α supercedes β. It means that if α is repaired, β will be repaired naturally. For instance, bug [*HIVE-4388*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-4388) is in the association of Supercedes with sub-task [*HIVE-3949*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-3949).
