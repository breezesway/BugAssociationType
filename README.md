# Bug Association Types
There are different types of the association between two bugs. We collected 16 types of bug associations from JIRA1. Supposing that bug α is in an association (e.g., **Blocked**) with bug β, the 16 types of bug associations are described as follows:

+ **Blocked**: α Blocked β. Generally speaking, β appeared first, but β has not been repaired, and at this time, α related to it appeared. So if you want to solve α, you have to solve β first. For instance, bug [*HIVE-12872*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-12872) says NoSuchMethodError exception Clause in Hive 1.1.1, and the cause of this issue is bug [*HIVE-11249*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-11249), which says Issue in WHERE Clause in Hive1.1.1, so we have to fix [*HIVE-11249*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-11249) before fixing [*HIVE-12872*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-12872).

+ **Blocker**: α Blocker β. It is the opposite type to Blocked, i.e. we have to solve α first and then β. For instance, bug [*HIVE-22433*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-22433) means Hive JDBC Storage Handler: Incorrect results fetched from BOOLEAN and TIMESTAMP DataType From JDBC Data Source, bug [*HIVE-22392*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-22392) means Hive JDBC Storage Handler: Support For Writing Data to JDBC Data Source, if you want to add [*HIVE-22392*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-22392) this new feature, the [*HIVE-22433*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-22433) bug must be fixed first.

+ **ChildIssue**: α is a parent of β. α may involve multiple components, and β is a more specific link or step in α. For instance, The new feature [*HIVE-163*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-163) means support loading json data into hive, and in order to implement this new feature, multiple modifications may be made, among which [*HIVE-18785*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-18785) means Make JSON SerDe First-Class SerDe.
+ **Cloners**: α is a clone of β. α and β are actually the same problem. For instance, both bug [*HIVE-13889*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-13889) and bug [*HIVE-13635*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-13635) indicate that HiveServer2 shows stack trace when parsing invalid inputs, and both [*HIVE-12926*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-12926) and [*HIVE-12927*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-12927) indicate Synchronization issues with tez/llap session pool in hs2.
+ **Container**: α contains β. α represents a larger-scale modification, and β represents a small modification that needs to be done in order to correspond to a change, like a sub-task. For instance, bug [*HIVE-13930*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-13930) means upgrade Hive to Hadoop 2.7.2, and there is a sub-task [*HIVE-14319*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-14319) means update encryption\_move\_tbl.q when switching Hive to use Hadoop 2.7.
+ **Dependency**: α dependency β. The solution of α depends on β, or repairing β is a precondition for repairing α. Unlike Blocked, Dependency is not a causal relationship. At this time, α and β are just different links before and after solving a problem. For instance, bug [*HIVE-18518*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-18518) means Upgrade druid version to 0.11.0, bug [*HIVE-17627*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-17627) means Use druid scan query instead of the select query, so we have to fix bug [*HIVE-18518*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-18518) first, and then fix bug [*HIVE-17627*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-17627).
+ **Dependent**: α depends upon β. Like Dependency, α also depends on β, but the difference is how to solve α depends on how β is solved. The solution of β is different, so the solution of α is also different. For instance, bug [*HIVE-11787*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-11787) means Remove the redundant columns in TAB\_COL\_STATS and PART\_COL\_STATS, bug [*HIVE-11786*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-11786) means Deprecate the use of redundant column in colunm stats related tables, We can only determine how to fix bug [*HIVE-11787*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-11787) after bug [*HIVE-11786*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-11786) is fixed.
+ **Duplicate**: α duplicates β. α and β represent the same bug, but unlike Cloners, Duplicate is reported by different people, while Cloners is reported by the same person. For instance, bug [*HIVE-12746*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-12746) says when dropping external hive tables, hive metastore should not check the hdfs path write permission, bug [*HIVE-9020*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-9020) says When dropping external tables, Hive should not verify whether user has access to the data. It means the same thing.
+ **Incorporates**: α incorporates β. β is a part of α. β belongs to a small modification in α, and Incorporates is different from Container, which is sometimes a combination of multiple bugs. For instance, bug [*HIVE-9809*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-9809) is composed of 14 bugs such as bug [*HIVE-9949*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-9949) and bug [*HIVE-9932*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-9932). Similarly, bug [*HIVE-6892*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-6892) consists of 11 bugs including sub-task [*HIVE-8864*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-8864) and bug [*HIVE-8791*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-8791).
+ **ParentFeature**: α is a child of β. ParentFeatue and ChildIssue are opposite relationships. For instance, improvement [*AMQ-6764*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-6764) means Add ended statement to Audit log for JMX ops, new feature [*AMQ-3100*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-3100) means Enable audit logging of user activities.  For secured environments we should enable track of user actions, so there are [*AMQ-6764*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-6764).
+ **Problem/Incident**: α causes β. This is a very direct causal relationship, that is, β is caused by α. For instance, bug [*HIVE-20221*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-20221) says Increase column width for partition\_params, bug [*HIVE-20833*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-20833) says package.jdo needs to be updated to conform with [*HIVE-20221*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-20221) changes.
+ **Reference**: α relates to β. This is a relatively broad relationship, which may represent a causal, before-and-after, repetition, or whole-and-part relationship between two bugs, and any connection can be classified into this category. For isntance, bug [*HIVE-21675*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-21675) for CREATE VIEW IF NOT EXISTS broken and bug [*HIVE-20462*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-20462) for "CREATE VIEW IF NOT EXISTS" fails if view already exists, these are two duplicate bugs that can also be placed in the Cloners category.
+ **Regression**: α breaks β. The appearance of β is related to the modification of α, there may be a causal relationship between α and β, but unlike Problem/Incident, this relationship may not be so direct and sometimes may not. For instance, bug [*HIVE-11208*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-11208) said Can not drop a default partition \_\_HIVE\_DEFAULT\_PARTITION\_\_ which is not a "string" type, this bug led to bug [*HIVE-15923*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-15923) in the subsequent development process, it said Hive default partition causes errors in get partitions.
+ **Related**: α is related to β. Related and Reference are a pair of opposite relationships, the example in Reference can also be written as bug [*HIVE-20462*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-20462) is related to bug [*HIVE-21675*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-21675).
+ **Required**: α requires β. Solving α requires solving β first, but unlike Dependency, Reuqired does not represent a context, and β may just be an extra step in the process of solving α. For instance, bug [*HIVE-12302*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-12302) means Use KryoPool instead of thread-local caching, and in order to use KryoPool, there is a premise that Upgrade Kryo version to 3.0.x, improvement [*HIVE-12175*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-12175) officially means this.
+ **Supercedes**: α supercedes β. It means that α replaces β, only need to repair α, β will be repaired naturally. For instance, bug [*HIVE-4388*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-4388) means Upgrade HBase to 0.96, sub-task [*HIVE-3949*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-3949) means HCatalog Pig Adapter test does not compile under hadoop2, just fix bug [*HIVE-4388*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-4388), then HCatalog Pig Adapter test can compile under hadoop2, so sub-task [*HIVE-3949*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-3949) is naturally fixed.
