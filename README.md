# Bug Association Types
There are different types of the association between two bugs. We collected 16 types of bug associations from JIRA1. Supposing that bug α is in an association (e.g., **Blocked**) with bug β, the 16 types of bug associations are described as follows:

+ **Blocked**: α is blocked by β. β occurs before α, α is in association with β, and β has not been fixed when α occurs. α can be fixed only when β has been fixed. For instance, the cause of bug [*HIVE-12872*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-12872) is bug [*HIVE-11249*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-11249), and thus [*HIVE-11249*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-11249) needs to be fixed before fixing [*HIVE-12872*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-12872).

+ **Blocker**: α blocks β. It is the opposite association type of Blocked, i.e. we have to solve α first and then β. For instance, bug [*HIVE-22433*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-22433) blocks bug [*HIVE-22392*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-22392),thus if you want to add [*HIVE-22392*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-22392) this new feature, the [*HIVE-22433*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-22433) bug must be fixed first.

+ **ChildIssue**: α is a parent of β. α may involve multiple components, and β is a more specific link or step in α. For instance, new feature [*HIVE-163*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-163) indicates support loading json data into hive, and in order to implement this new feature, multiple modifications may be made, among which [*HIVE-18785*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-18785) indicates Make JSON SerDe First-Class SerDe.
+ **Cloners**: α is a clone of β. α and β are the same issue and their descriptions are the same as well. For instance, both bug [*HIVE-13889*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-13889) and bug [*HIVE-13635*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-13635) indicate that HiveServer2 shows stack trace when parsing invalid inputs, and both [*HIVE-12926*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-12926) and [*HIVE-12927*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-12927) indicate Synchronization issues with tez/llap session pool in hs2.
+ **Container**: α contains β. Usually, β appears first, and then α, which has a larger scope and involves more components than β, appears. Generally, β is repaired first, and then α is repaired. Unlike Blocked, the repair order does not have to be to repair β first, then repair α, or repair α first, and then repair β. Unlike ChildIssue, Container is a larger issue found in the subsequent development process, and ChildIssue is some small or specific issues listed later. For instance, bug [*HIVE-12039*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-12039) indicates Temporarily disable TestSSL#testSSLVersion, then there was a bug [*HIVE-12773*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-12773) indicates Address current test case failures in Hive.
+ **Dependency**: α dependency β. The solution of α depends on β, or repairing β is a precondition for repairing α. Unlike Blocked, Dependency is not a causal relationship. α and β are just different links before and after solving an issue. For instance, bug [*HIVE-18518*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-18518) indicates Upgrade druid version to 0.11.0, bug [*HIVE-17627*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-17627) indicates Use druid scan query instead of the select query, so we have to fix bug [*HIVE-18518*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-18518) first, and then fix bug [*HIVE-17627*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-17627).
+ **Dependent**: α depends upon β. Like Dependency, α also depends on β, but the difference is how to solve α depends on how β is solved. The solution of β is different, so the solution of α is also different. For instance, bug [*HIVE-11787*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-11787) indicates Remove the redundant columns in TAB\_COL\_STATS and PART\_COL\_STATS, bug [*HIVE-11786*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-11786) indcates Deprecate the use of redundant column in colunm stats related tables, We can only determine how to fix bug [*HIVE-11787*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-11787) after bug [*HIVE-11786*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-11786) is fixed.
+ **Duplicate**: α duplicates β. α and β represent the same bug, but unlike Cloners, Duplicate is reported by different people, while Cloners is reported by the same person. For instance, bug [*HIVE-12746*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-12746) indicates when dropping external Hive tables, Hive metastore should not check the hdfs path write permission, bug [*HIVE-9020*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-9020) indicates When dropping external tables, Hive should not verify whether user has access to the data. It means the same thing.
+ **Incorporates**: α incorporates β. β is a part of α. β is a small modification of α, and Incorporates is different from Container, which is sometimes a combination of multiple bugs. For instance, bug [*HIVE-9809*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-9809) is composed of 14 bugs such as bug [*HIVE-9949*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-9949) and bug [*HIVE-9932*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-9932). Similarly, bug [*HIVE-6892*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-6892) consists of 11 bugs including sub-task [*HIVE-8864*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-8864) and bug [*HIVE-8791*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-8791).
+ **ParentFeature**: α is a child of β. ParentFeature and ChildIssue are opposite relationships. For instance, improvement [*AMQ-6764*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-6764) indicates Add ended statement to Audit log for JMX ops, new feature [*AMQ-3100*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-3100) indicates Enable audit logging of user activities.  For secured environments we should enable track of user actions, so there is [*AMQ-6764*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-6764).
+ **Problem/Incident**: α causes β. This is a very direct causal relationship, i.e., β is caused by α. For instance, bug [*HIVE-20221*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-20221) indicates Increase column width for partition\_params, bug [*HIVE-20833*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-20833) indicates package.jdo needs to be updated to conform with [*HIVE-20221*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-20221) changes.
+ **Reference**: α relates to β. This is a relatively broad relationship, which may represent a causal, before-and-after, repetition, or whole-and-part relationship between two bugs, and any association can be classified into this type. For isntance, bug [*HIVE-21675*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-21675) for CREATE VIEW IF NOT EXISTS broken and bug [*HIVE-20462*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-20462) for "CREATE VIEW IF NOT EXISTS" fails if view already exists, these are two duplicate bugs that can also be placed in the type of Duplicate .
+ **Regression**: α breaks β. The appearance of β is related to the modification of α, that is, the changes made in the process of repairing α lead to β. For instance, bug [*HIVE-12366*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-12366) indicates Refactor Heartbeater logic for transaction, in the process of making changes to bug [*HIVE-12366*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-12366) caused bug [*HIVE-18090*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-18090), which indicates acid heartbeat fails when metastore is connected via hadoop credential.
+ **Related**: α is related to β. Related and Reference are a pair of opposite relationships, the example in Reference can also be written as bug [*HIVE-20462*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-20462) is related to bug [*HIVE-21675*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-21675).
+ **Required**: α requires β. Solving α requires solving β first, but unlike Dependency, Reuqired does not represent a context, and β may just be an extra step in the process of solving α. For instance, bug [*HIVE-12302*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-12302) indicates Use KryoPool instead of thread-local caching, and in order to use KryoPool, there is a premise that Upgrade Kryo version to 3.0.x, improvement [*HIVE-12175*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-12175) officially indicates this.
+ **Supercedes**: α supercedes β. It means that α replaces β, only need to repair α, β will be repaired naturally. For instance, bug [*HIVE-4388*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-4388) indicates Upgrade HBase to 0.96, sub-task [*HIVE-3949*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-3949) indicates HCatalog Pig Adapter test does not compile under hadoop2, just fix bug [*HIVE-4388*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-4388), then HCatalog Pig Adapter test can compile under hadoop2, so sub-task [*HIVE-3949*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-3949) is naturally fixed.
